# 7E1

Name a hypothetical third variable that would lead to an interaction effect: 

1. "Bread dough rises because of yeast" 

Temperature, acidity

2. "Education leads to higher income" 
 
Gender, race, socioeconomic status, year (did you graduate in a down year?), major

3. "Gasoline makes a car go"

Cyclinders in the engine (rate at which gasoline makes the car go depends on the size of the engine), type of engine (electric cars don't need gas at all)

_I'm finding that I'm thinking "well, it depends" for a lot of these and I'm not sure that's sufficient.
